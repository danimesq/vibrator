		<h1 data-l10n-id="howtoTitle1">How to use?</h1>
			<p data-l10n-id="howtop1">In order to get the maximum of pleasure with this app, you should follow the
			following advice. It tells you when, where and how and why it is the best to use it.</p>
		<h2 data-l10n-id="howtoTitle2">When?</h2>
			<p data-l10n-id="howtop2">The most important is the moment when you'll use it. You have to reserve a special
			moment when you know you will not be disturbed. Ideally, it is a moment in the afternoon, when you can relax
			and you're not too tired. You can planify a few minutes or more than an hour ;)</p>
		<h2 data-l10n-id="howtoTitle3">Where?</h2>
			<p data-l10n-id="howtop3">We are talking here about using a pseudo sextoy. So, don't think to use it at work
			or in any public place! you should instead relax and lie down on your bed, or on the sofa... The position is
			important too!</p>
		<h2 data-l10n-id="howtoTitle4">How?</h2>
			<p data-l10n-id="howtop4">The first thing you must know is that your phone is <em>not</em> a real sextoy. Of
			course, you must not insert it in any intimate part. But this also means that it will not give you as much
			pleasure as a real sextoy would. More important, in addition of the vibrations, you'll need more stimulation
			to get an orgasm.</p>
			<p data-l10n-id="howtop42">So, the first thing is to warm you up! You can start the vibrations slowly and
			caress yourself with the phone on your breast, and put it on your clitoris. Let it vibrate here, changing
			the vibrations until you get really wet. Then, you can do whatever you want!</p>
		<h2 data-l10n-id="howtoTitle5">Why?</h2>
			<p data-l10n-id="howtop5">It is important to take time for yourself and relax. And moreover, it is really
			important to have pleasure!</p>
		<h2 data-l10n-id="howtoTitle6">Alone or not?</h2>
			<p data-l10n-id="howtop6">OK... This question sounds really creepy... Yet, it can be very pleasant to use
			this app as a couple. The best example is during a massage. It is a really good idea to begin the massage
			making the phone vibrate on different parts of the body to loosen them, and / or arouse the "massagee".</p>
			<p data-l10n-id="howtop62">Then, you can finish the massage the way you want...</p>
